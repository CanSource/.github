CanSource is the "Canterbury Open Source Hardware Group," we're a small group of researchers and
designers based around Canterbury, New Zealand with the common goal of developing open source
hardware. Part of this goal is to provide excellent documentation for our open source hardware as
a way for people to learn more about electronics. This means documenting our design process and
not just the design itself.

CanSource is in its infancy in the moment. Please be patient whilst we grow :) We hope to setup
some guides to contributing soon. As soon as they and any other important information is ready
it will be added to the [Meta Repository](https://github.com/CanSource/meta).
